# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and implement an ATM & Banking System using software engineering principles. The system should simulate key banking functions such as account creation, user authentication, cash withdrawal, deposit, balance enquiry, and management.

# SRS (Procedure):
Analyze project requirements for an ATM & Banking System based on real-world banking functions.

Identify actors (e.g., User, Admin) and relevant system use cases.

Document functional and non-functional requirements in an SRS.

Draw appropriate diagrams based on system flow (e.g., Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, Communication, Package diagrams).

Select and justify technology and software tools for system implementation.

Design the user interface for streamlined banking operations.

Develop the backend logic to handle transactions securely.

Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Test the system for all supported transaction scenarios.

Verify correct handling of exceptions and edge cases (like insufficient balance).
